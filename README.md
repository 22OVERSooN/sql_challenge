Data Mpdeling

The most difficult part is how to find the primary key and also the foreign along with it. Initially I thought that the emp_no as a primary key should be listed into the employees csv, but I've been through several failure when I try to import. Actually, emp_no inside Salaries should be the primary key.

Data Analysis
1. Basically most of the questions can be answered by using JOIN
2.There is only one probelms that how to export sql file, Pgadmin can let you backup a sql file but it's not in order...need to re-type.
3.Also it's very hard to seperate the query file and table file...
